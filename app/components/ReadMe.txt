this area of the directory may be in need of review. My understanding of components may not be sound. The example from scotch.io suggests that I use this folder for all of the static views, directives, and services for each specific section of the site. This is seemingly what I've done, however it also mentions that an examples provided are an 'admin user's section' and a 'gallery creation section'. Are these adminable pages or are they user static pages?
